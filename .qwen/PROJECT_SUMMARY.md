# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Implement aeronautical sight reduction functionality in a celestial navigation library to support navigation from aircraft using bubble sextants and aviation-specific procedures, while maintaining compatibility with existing marine navigation capabilities.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Python with Astropy library for celestial calculations, Pandas for data handling, Matplotlib for plotting
- **Navigation Modes**: Dual-mode operation supporting both 'marine' (traditional) and 'aviation' (aircraft-specific) navigation
- **Core Aviation Features**:
  - Bubble sextant support (artificial horizon, no dip correction)
  - Aircraft movement compensation for position changes during flight
  - Flight altitude atmospheric corrections for refraction
  - Aviation table integration (simulated Pub. No. 249 functionality)
- **File Structure**:
  - `src/sight_reduction.py`: Main sight reduction functions with navigation mode support
  - `src/aviation_almanac.py`: Aviation-specific almanac and table functionality
  - `src/problem_generator.py`: Updated to support aviation scenarios
  - `tests/test_aviation_functionality.py`: New comprehensive test suite
- **API Changes**: Extended functions to include `navigation_mode`, `aircraft_speed_knots`, `aircraft_course`, `time_interval_hours`, and altitude-based refraction
- **Testing**: All 88 tests pass, including 12 new aviation-specific tests

## Recent Actions
